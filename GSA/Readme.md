### Summary

Galactic Star Alliance (GSA) is a far-future science fiction roleplaying game, set in a galaxy full of wonder, tenticled monstrosities, and treasure. Players take one of many roles: warrior, scientist, trader or tour guide, travelling across the Milky Way in search of wars, wonders or wonga. 

### History

#### Origins

Humanity spread throughout the galaxy in the late 2900s, after the development of the non-locality(NL) drive. It found a galaxy teeming with sentient alien races, but few as technologically advanced as humanity. After years of exploration it was realised that there had been many races more advanced than us, but they had suddenly vanished, leaving only mysterious ruins and a stockpile of exotic matter we call MyB-n (pronounced Mib-En or My-Bin). The leading theory is that races that reach a sufficient level of technology become "unbound", leaving the limits of space and time behind. 

NOTE: MyB-n is a silver-coloured metal that is exists in a strange island of stability well beyond the heaviest elements on the periodic table. How it is made remains a mystery, even to 37th century scientists.

Hundreds of colony worlds were settled, across the entire expance of the galaxy. By 3400 A.D. humanity held a dominant position in the galaxy, having shared its technologies with many alien races, helping them to set up their own colonies.For hundreds of years, the galactic civilisation expands and thrives.

#### Empire

The Galactic Empire is formed, establishing a common set of laws, trade regularions and a defense pact that keeps the peace for two hundred years. The empire's power is based on the possession of an exotic form of matter, called MyB-n. A substance that is essential for starship hulls. While NL drives are well understood and staight forward to construct, ships that shunt between two stars require hulls that can survive extreme forces. Only MyB-n provides the necessary properties to support star travel.

Most MyB-n was found in ancient ruined cities by human explorers. When this stockpile is nearly exhausted it can no longer trade it with its non-aligned neighbours. 

#### Cracks in the wall

The supply of MyB-n begins to dwindle. The empire had used a monopoly on MyB-n supply to legitimise its power, feeding the needs of the frontier worlds in return for fealty. When the empire fears that it will exhaust its supply of MyB-n, it beings to hoard what remains and stops supplying it to the frontier worlds. These worlds fear relegation and eventual collapse, so they attempt to cede from the empire. In fact many worlds band together into outlier alliances that begin raiding imperial MyB-n caches. 

#### Sparks of war

The emperor gathers a fleet of warships. His aim is to subjugate the troublemakers and return the rebelling worlds to imperial control. To this end he assigns his most decorated and respected soldier, General Hona Octavian. To counter the empire, the outlier alliance calls to service their most respected strategist, Katheryn Nareen Pevril. The galaxy braces for conflict. It's feared that fighting might spread to all quarters, devastating the galaxy.

#### End of empire

In the moment that everyone feared hostilities would start, there is instead a lightning raid on the imperial palace. A bloodless coup. The imperal war master, General Octavian had secretly counciled with his opposite, Katheryn Pevril. They had agreed that a galactic war served no one's interest, except for helping the emperor cling to power. The emperor is deposed, his older brother who had been cheated out of the throne as a child, is crowned as the new emperor. The new emperor immediately begins a drastic series of reforms. Within five years the empire is replaced by a new galactic government, one that cedes more control to its member worlds. 

#### The Galactic Star Alliance

The new galactic government is more decentralised. Galactic transportation shifts from fleets of starships to a network of static stargates between major trade hubs, greatly reducing the need for MyB-n. The old empire had refused to build a stargates network because it had rightly feared that it would spell the end of its main source of power. Now most galactic transport can travel across the galaxy by going through a series of portals. Starships then transport cargo from the hub system to neighbouring star systems. The stargate network becomes strategically vital and is somewhat fragile.

#### Opposing forces

While the GSA ushers in an era of increased freedom and justice, not everyone supports the new order. The Chouza Combine is formed by disaffected nobles, angry at the loss of their power. They originally aimed to return the old empire. Over time it becomes apparent that this will never happen, so instead they want to gripple the GSA, so they might gain power from the resulting vacuum.

The loss of the empire's "firm hand" resulted in an increase in piracy. Powerful pirate princes appear, operating from secret bases on hidden worlds. Like the Combine, they seek to destabilize the GSA, although they are less unified than the combine, and are more prone to in-fighting.

Some galactic races, previously held in check by the empire are now attempting to expand, or are feel that they can act more agressively against the GSA. The Unintended are an alien AI construct that swallows up star systems turning them into factories for drone swarms. When an unintended swarm arrives in a star system it replicates exponentially until planets and major asteroids are stripped to bedrock. Thankfully the jump from system to system is infrequent.
