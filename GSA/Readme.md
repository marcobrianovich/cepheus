### Summary

Galactic Star Alliance (GSA) is a far-future science fiction roleplaying game, set in a galaxy full of wonder, tenticled monstrosities, and treasure. Players take one of many roles: warrior, scientist, trader or tour guide, travelling across the Milky Way in search of wars, wonders or wonga. 

#### History

Humanity spread throughout the galaxy in the late 2900s, after the development of the non-locality(NL) drive. It found many a galaxy teeming with sentient alien races, but not as technologically advanced as humanity. After years of exploration it was realised that many advanced races had come before us, but had since left for places unknown, leaving only mysterious ruins and a stockpile of exotic matter we call MyB-n. The leading theory is that races that reach sufficient level of technology because "unbound", leaving the limits of space and time behind. MyB-n is a silver
Hundreds of colony worlds were settled, across the entire expance of the galaxy. By 3400 A.D. humanity held a dominant position in the galaxy, having shared its technologies with many alien races, helping them to set up their own colonies. For hundreds of years, the galactic civilisation thrives. The Galactic Empire is formed, establishing a common set of laws, trade regularions and a defense pact that keeps the peace for two hundred years. The empire's power is based on the possession of an exotic form of matter, called MyB-n. A substance that is essential for starship hulls. While NL drives are well understood and staight forward to construct, ships that shunt between two stars require hulls that can survive extreme forces. Only MyB-n provides the necessary properties to support star travel.

Most MyB-n was found in ancient ruined cities by human explorers. When this stockpile is nearly exhausted it can no longer trade it with its non-aligned neighbours.
