# Orbital Elements: Hard Science Fiction Role-playing Game 

## What's Orbital Elements?

Is a science fiction role-playing game, set in the year 2288. The game is built in Cepheus Engine, an open-source derivative of the classic Traveller, which is truly the grandfather of all science fiction RPGs.


## The setting in a nutshell

### Humanity becomes the space race

Humanity has spread throughout the solar system, settling almost everywhere. There's no faster-than-light travel, or interstellar colonisation within the current play setting. Earth never recovered from the climate catastrophe of the 21st Century, its inhabitants now mostly live in archologies, vast monolithic structures that handle all living requirements without leaking CO2 or excessive heat into the atmosphere. For nearly two hundred years the remaining nations of the Earth have been migrating people out to countless space colonies and settlements.

### Factions of a fractured humanity

Many of the old nation-states continue to exist, and many of their colonies remain tied to ancestoral and cultural identity. However, many colonies have become nation-states in their own right, with evolving national identities that can differ wildly from that of their homeland's. Each nation has a collective opinion of what direction human progress should be heading towards. In 2288 humanity is split into the following camps:

#### Advancers

People who believe that humanity must embrance technology in order to become god-like.

#### Multiculturist

People who believe that individuals have the right to follow which ever path is believed to the most right.

#### Retroculurists

People who believe that continued alteration of humanity will be destructive. Retroculturists reject all technologies that threaten to modify humans. Extreme retroculturists reject all high-technology, at least at the point where it interferes with human living.

### Manufactured Intellects

Early in the 22nd century advanced self-aware artificial intelligence becomes a reality. Strict rules are enforced to ensure that such entities remain safe. All AIs are "bound", that is they're constructed with human thought structures that ensure that their primary motivation is the protection of humankind. As Bound AIs (BAIs) help create a technological renaissance, their abilities are held back by their human-friendly bounds.

Some parts of humanity responded to the growth of AI with hostility. Eventually this hostility boiled over into conflict. Many anti-AI groups form, some, like  Guardians For Mankind (GFM) used acts of terrorism to attempt "cleanse" humanity. Within thirty years most nations place themselves into camps that are either hostile or friendly towards BAIs. All the while violence towards AI escalates. In the 2170s, a group of BAIs secrety develop a new form of AI that will be better equipped to protect  BAIs from attack. Naturally, this new AI, called Athena is unbound.
