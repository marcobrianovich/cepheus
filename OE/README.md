# Orbital Elements: Hard Science Fiction Role-playing Game 

## What's Orbital Elements?

Orbital Elements is a science fiction role-playing game, set within the solar system in the year 2288. The game is built in Cepheus Engine, an open-source derivative of the classic Traveller, which is truly the grandfather of all science fiction RPGs.


## The setting in a nutshell

### Humanity becomes the space race

Humanity has spread throughout the solar system, settling almost everywhere. There's no faster-than-light travel, or interstellar colonisation within the current play setting. Earth never recovered from the climate catastrophe of the 21st Century, its inhabitants now mostly live in archologies, vast monolithic structures that handle all living requirements without leaking CO2 or excessive heat into the atmosphere. For nearly two hundred years the remaining nations of the Earth have been migrating people out to countless space colonies and settlements.

### Factions of a fractured humanity

Many of the old nation-states continue to exist, and many colonies remain tied to their ancestoral and cultural identity. However, by 2288 most large colonies have become nation-states in their own right, with evolving identities that can differ wildly from that of their homeland's. Each nation has a collective opinion of what direction human progress should be heading towards. In 2288 humanity is split into the following camps:

#### Advancers

People who believe that humanity must embrance technology in order to become god-like. The advancer movement is a broad, the most extreme advancers have already migrated into digital realms where their consciousness has been copied to the same hybrid bio-nanonic brain as AIs. These digital citizens live in various forms of cyberspace, some even live inside robotic bodies that operate in the physical realm.

Digital elevation is still very expensive, and isn't available to most citizens yet, the majority of advancers make do with genetic modification, implants and rejuve therapies.

#### Multiculturist

People who believe that individuals have the right to follow whichever path they believe to the most right. Nations that were based on Western democratic values took the idea of multiculturalism into space. Many of the large settlements on Luna and Mars protect the rights of individuals to follow whichever path that they wish. Alas, these societies often fail to constrain tensions that exist between competing groups.

#### Retroculurists

People who believe that the continued alteration of humanity will end in its destruction. Most retroculturists reject all technologies that threaten to significantly modify humans. Extreme retroculturists reject all high-technology, at least at the point where it interferes with human living. So it's possible for people to live pastoral pre-industrial lives inside a rotating asteroid, providing all the super-high technology that allows such a lifestyle to be out-of-sight. Retroculturist nations have fallen behind advancer nations in most technologies.

### Manufactured Intellects

Early in the 22nd century advanced self-aware artificial intelligence becomes a reality. Strict rules are enforced to ensure that such entities remain safe. All AIs are "bound", that is they're constructed with human thought structures that ensure that their primary motivation is the protection of humankind. Bound AIs (BAIs) help create a technological renaissance, yet their abilities are held back by their bindings. The potential dangers of unbound AIs make their creation a crime on par with creating deadly plagues or atom bombs.

Some parts of humanity responded to the growth of AI with hostility. Eventually this hostility boiled over into conflict. Many anti-AI groups form, some, like  Guardians For Mankind (GFM) used acts of terrorism in an attempt to "cleanse" humanity. Within thirty years most nations place themselves into camps that are either hostile or friendly towards BAIs. All the while violence towards AI escalates. In the 2170s, a group of BAIs secrety develop a new form of AI that will be better equipped to protect  BAIs from attack. Naturally, this new AI, called Athena is unbound. 

### 1st AI War

In 2188 an attack against an BAI target by an anti-AI terrorist group is quickly foiled. Hours later, the home settlement of the attackers is destroyed by an unknown force.
