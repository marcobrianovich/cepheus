* *Solar Particle Event (SPE)* The sun frequently emits accerated protons as part of a solar storm. These events rarely had significant impact on Earth-bound people but are noteworthy for people elsewhere in the solar systems. All colonies and large settlements are resistant to storms but for individuals wandering around outside, these events can be extremely hazardous unless anti-radiation treatment is taken.
