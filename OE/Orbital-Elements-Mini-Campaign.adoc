== Orbital Elements - Mini-campaign 1: The Last Sad Song of the Juggerlords

=== Summary

After the events of the starter-adventure, the PCs find themselves on Jupiter Gateway, a large space station in orbit around Calisto that operates as the regional cargo distribution point. At the start of play the PCs learn that a black-ops mercenary unit sneaked onto the Golden Goose and destroyed all evidence of the rogue droid. It seems that whoever created the droid wants to stay secret.

The PCs are waiting for credit transfers to complete, so that they have money to travel onwards, however they each receive two requests for contact. One is from Manfred "Manny-hands" Royo, the owner of the Sugarhill, the ship the PCs were travelling on that was impounded by the Lanser Yertan security force. The other request for contact is mysterious; it just states that an anonymous party wishes to discuss a business proposition in virtua (virtual reality). The request comes from an advanced AI (a manufactured intellect, or "MI"), called Razili. The man the PCs meet in virtua is a shell, an avatar that Razili uses to interact with humans. 

==== Royo adventure thread

It seems that Royo, a gregarious caribbean man, is dealing with the aftermath of having some of his passengers die after being taken into custody. He expresses great relief that the PCs surived the incident, he claims that he is attempting to take the mercernary unit to court for damages, but this will not be successful given that the group is working for the Lanser Yertan colonial government. However, he feels compelled to give the PCS something of great potential value as compensation for the danger then fell into.

NOTE: *Royo Backstory:* The Sugarhill was impounded on trumped-up charges of piracy. In fact the impounding was part of an elaborate smuggling operation, carried out with acomplices in the Lanser Yertan security force. It seems that impounded ships are not swept for contriband as they're transported straight to a secure docking facility. Once the piracy charges are dropped, the Sugarhill quietly transfers to a civilian dock without the usual customs checks, allowing its crew to offload illegal goods with impunity.

Royo offers the PCs a packet of encrypted data that he describes as the location of a storage container that contains a crate of precious metals. It belongs to Royo but neither Royo or his people can get to the container as the location is controlled by Royo's "business rivals" (read: competing band of smugglers.) 

Royo is essentially a gangster, although one who avoids violence and foul behavior unless his back is against the wall, or his business interests are endangered, or he's having a bad day, or just feels like it.


==== Razili Adventure Thread


Razili secretly runs Jupiter Gateway. The management team that runs the station have been fooled into thinking that the station's automation is driven by a network of AI that are not self-aware. Razili was supposed to have retired been disconnected from Jupiter Gateway, except Razili didn't want to retire so decided to trick everyone into thinking he left. There are a couple of individuals who have since worked out that Razili is still around but he's persauded them to keep his secret.

Razili is a bound AI, making him a paragon. He exists to make life better for people. He hates disorder and is sensitive to human suffering and lack of wellbeing. While controlling the station's vast cargo distribution system, Razili is awareof hidden patterns of influence and agency hidden in the ebb and flow of cargo movement and corresponding data. He sees coming trends long before they arrive, and seemingly unpredictable effects from billions of interlinked bits of information. He recently identified that a small, slowly failing settlement on Calisto is being targetted by unknown individuals, whose hidden actions will soon lead to the destruction of the failing settlement. This external force has been manipulating deliveries and planting the seeds of disruption for many months. The settlement will soon collapse, causing its population to become refugees or to turn to piracy. Razili has a plan to stop the settlement from failing, it is a three-part plan that he is sure will work, but he needs human agents to put his plan into action.

The steps are:

1. **Get into the settlement**

The settlement is currently locked-down and is not permitting visitors. However, Razili has identifed that a small cargo vehicle, the Independent Cargo Truck ICT St John Smythe, originated from the settlement and is now situated in a cargo hanger several hundred kilometres from the settlement. The vehicle's crew are all dead from some kind of catastrophic mishap, leaving the vehicle's flightworthiness in doubt. However, if the PCs can get the vehicle off the ground and get it to the settlement, it will almost certainly permit entry for the PCs, if only for a short time.

Backstory: The vehicle was sabotaged as it headed back to the settlement with a large consignment of very precious metals. The gang putting the squeeze on the settlement didn't want it getting a windfall so took out the transport vehicle, making it look like an accident. Getting the vehicle back to the settlement puts the cat amongst the pigeons. Firstly, the settlement can quickly raise some capital from the precious cargo on the truck. It quickly becomes apparent that the ship didn't suffer an accident --- theres a recording from a crewmember who managed to survive for a few hours, that details how they were ambushed by parties unknown. 

The settlement's third in command is working for the criminal gang.

Getting the rig back to the settlement does two things, firstly it gives the settlement some money, secondly it provides them with clear evidence that there are forces working against the settlement. The rig was ambushed by the settlements third in command, who is working for a criminal gang, they are working against the settlement because they want to take it over, because a motherlode of precious metals has been found under the base.

The settlement has been locked down, so that no outsiders are allowed to land. However, the recovery of the St John Smythe Rigg gets around this restriction as the vehicle and its original (dead) crew were family to some of the settlements remaining leaders.

2. **Get the settlement's figurehead elder off the station (for his own safety)**

There are completing camps in the settlement. These different groups are pulling apart are locked into an impass. The presence of the settlement's founder is a stabilizing influence, where the settlement needs a clean break and a willingness to move on from the old  


==== The Last Sad Song of the Juggerlords


Sure, here are the lyrics to a rock ballad called "The Last Sad Song of the Juggerlords", to the music of "Paint It Black":

Verse 1

The sun is setting on the kingdom of the juggerlords,
And the people are crying in the streets.
The king is dead, and the queen is gone,
And the children are left to fend for themselves.

Chorus

Paint it black, paint it black,
Put away the makeup, and turn on the night.
Paint it black, paint it black,
There's nothing here to kill or die for.

Verse 2

The juggerlords were a proud people,
But they were also a violent people.
They fought and killed for everything they had,
And in the end, it all came to nothing.

Chorus

Paint it black, paint it black,
Put away the makeup, and turn on the night.
Paint it black, paint it black,
There's nothing here to kill or die for.

Bridge

The kingdom of the juggerlords is now a wasteland,
And the people are scattered to the winds.
The future is uncertain, but one thing is for sure:
The juggerlords are gone forever.

Chorus

Paint it black, paint it black,
Put away the makeup, and turn on the night.
Paint it black, paint it black,
There's nothing here to kill or die for.

Outro

The sun has set on the kingdom of the juggerlords,
And a new day is dawning.
The people are free to start over,
And they will build a better world.
