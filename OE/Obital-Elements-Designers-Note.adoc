== Themes

=== Solar system-based

OE is set in a widely colonised solar system. There are missions to nearby starts, but for the beginning of the game, these are outside the scope of play.

=== Tribes

OE is a game about nationalism / tribalism. The old nations of Earth still exist, although they are much changed. As the human colonisation of the solar system has progressed, new nations have formed. New alliences and new adversaries. 

=== AI

"The machines" have risen. There are colonies that are entirely machine-based. Run by powerful AIs that are idependent of human control. Some human colonies are openly hostile to AIs, other colonies are on good terms with the AIs.

Nobody is completely sure what the AI's agenda really is. They are mysterious.


=== Extra-terrestrials



=== Chronology

*21st Century* +

Another century of great transition. Automation and AI drive changes in working and econonic systems. The climate catastrophe is not stopped in time, resulting in turmoil and massive population movements. While there is never a true "world war", small conflicts over dwindling resources become more common. The century ends with the beginning of the second space age.

*2041* Progress in the development of general AI stalls. More specialised froms of AI become ever more capable but sentience remains elusive. Technological singularity never quite happens. While advanced computer systems can iterate research and design very quickly, the requirements for fabrication and process design and the motivation to adopt slow down change enough so that people don't get lost or go crazy. _If a new mobile phone came out every day, would you buy it?_ 

*2042* The first extra-terrestrial colony is founded on the Moon (Luna). While efforts to establish a Marsian colony is stalled by numerous technical and economic challenges, Luna grows fast, driven by the development of mining and resource extraction.

*2050*  The impact of global warming accelerates faster that predicted, leading to a generation of economic collapse, countless low-level conflicts and seemingly endless destructive extreme weather events. 

*2051* Phosphorous War. The global supply of phosphorous is dwindling, creating pressure on global agriculuture. Morocco capitalises on its possession of 70% of the world's Phosphate rock, controlling supply to increase market price. The global powers, invade Morocco and force its government to place Phosphorus supply under the control over an international organisation. Morocco becomes increadibly wealthly, Rhabat and Morocco become global cities.

*2052*  The founder of Mars colony passes away. The Marsian colonisation effort proved to be far more difficult and costly than expected, but by the start of the 2050 there is increased interest and investment, as the wealthy start to see Mars, Luna and planned "orbitals" as a pontential escape from increasing chaos of Earth-bound life.

*2053* Biodiversity has been massively reduced. Vast areas of land become deserts. There are nearly constant violent hurricane storms. Human populations shift to archology structures where all living requirements are handled from within massive highrise structures, or under protective domes (for the wealthy). 


*2054*  Nuclear Fusion power plants finally begins to deliver on the century-long promise of cheap, plentiful electricity. However, most of Earth's power needs have long been met by renewable energy, most nations build a small number of Fusion plants to more easily feed spikes in demand or make up shortfalls when solar or wind output falls. Fusion plants are also miniturised for use in sea-faring ships, while work continues to make them suitable for space travel.

*2061*  First armed conflict on the Moon, when a legal fight the over ownership of a huge Helium-3 reserve boils into a skirmish between European Federation mercenaries and Pacific Aliance soldiers. Fighting is quickly brought to an end by the signing of the Mumbai Accords which set up an international committee for arbitrating settlement and exploitation rights. Helium-3 is the new "oil", its value rockets as Fusion becomes the preferred power source. All nations want to claim it and control its supply. As with oil, in the previous century, the thirst for Helium-3 begins to poison national interests, to the extent that a space arms industry is born out of the will to keep this strategically vital resource from being taken by aversaries.

*2071* 

*2075* 
*2081* 

*22nd Century* +

The next century is chiefly defined by the massive push for space colonisation. Earth is increasingly inhospitable. Old agricultural practices become increasingly unreliable and in may places unfeasible. 



*2130* As the demand for Helium 3 now outstrips supply, it becomes economically feasible to develop extraction stations that skim the upper atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. Larger stations are planned that will lower collection pipes down.

*23rd Century* +

Strange times.
