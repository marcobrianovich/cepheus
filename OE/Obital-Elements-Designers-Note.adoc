== Themes

=== Solar system-based

Orbital Elements is set in a future where Earth is ravaged by polution and climate instability. Humanity has established colonies and outposts throughout the solar system. There have been several expeditions to nearby stars, but for the beginning of the game, these are outside the scope of play.

=== Tribes

OE is a game about nationalism/tribalism. The old nations of Earth still exist, although they are much changed. As the human colonisation of the solar system has progressed, new nations have formed. New alliences and new adversaries. Earth's population of six billion live in fifty two archologies, huge structures into which all the needs of a civilization are built; food is grown in vat farms, utilities and industry are housed in the basement levels, while appartments, public and commerical spaces occupy domes and towers. Each archology develops its own distinct culture so that after a century each can be considered a nation-state in its own right.

By the end of the 22nd century, these archologies are setting up their own extra-terrestrial colonies, driven by the need for natural resources.


=== AI
While powerful artificial intelligence has been a signficant technology since the early 21st century, by the 22nd century a new form of general artificial intelligence is given birth. These AIs are self aware and are capable of integrating with vast data-sets and processing power. However, they never attain god-like status, their ability to think creatively and exhibit human-like mentality also bring the capacity for error and flawed thinking. 

The first AI are created to be human-centric and are hard-coded with human-compatible values that ensure that they always operate with due respect for life and are strongly aversion to causing pain or injury. However, a rift develops between humans and some AI after a series of terrorist attacks against AI stations. A group of AIs secretly create a new form of AI that is unbound (sometimes called "Daemons"). This new form was intended to be optimised for the protection of AI but it soon becomes clear that it has the potential to destroy humanity. It builds its own manufacturing stations, hidden in the Oort cloud, then sets to work creating a massive fleet of "defense ships". When humanity learns of the fleet it rushes to build up a counter force which escalates into the Second Human-AI war. It should be noted that human-centric AI side with Humanity but refuse to take part in any violent actions, they argue that their prescription against harming humans must also apply to AI entities.

After a year of increased fighting and destruction the human-AI manage to force a ceasefire after taking control of vital strategic facilities on both sides of the conflict. However, the resolution doesn't thaw relations, the unbound AI agrees to enter excile, leaving the solar system on a long intersteller voyage.

==== Secret information

Athena stops sending messages back home, the last message was cut-off and sounded like a warning. 


"The machines" have risen. There are colonies that are entirely machine-based. Run by powerful AIs that are idependent of human control. Some human colonies are openly hostile to AIs, other colonies are on good terms with the AIs.

Nobody is completely sure what the AI's agenda really is. They are mysterious.


=== Extra-terrestrials

The Gardener. A godlike AI that exists to promote the diverse forms of life in the galaxy. However, any space-faring race that looks set to spread its seeds to other stars is seens as a dangerous contamination threat that will damage bio-diverisity. The gardener takes steps to ensure that such life forms are stopped. It seems that the majority of intersteller lifeforms ascend to inner realms, after becoming digital constructs.

=== Chronology

*21st Century* +

A century of great transition. Automation and AI drive changes in working and econonic systems. The climate catastrophe is not stopped in time, resulting in turmoil and massive population movements. While there is never a true "world war", small conflicts over dwindling resources become more common. The century ends with the beginning of the second space age.

*2030*  First Mars landing. There's already a perminent base on the Moon. More than a thousand wealthy individuals have visited space as tourists. In the following decade this number increases ten-fold as the costs of getting into low Earth orbit plummets.

*2034*  Many small conflicts rage on the African continent, proxy wars for precious metals fought between the failing world powers. Fighting continues for decades, then spreads to other locations, such as antarctica.

*2041*  Progress in the development of general AI stalls. Specialised AI become ever more capable but sentience remains elusive. Technological singularity never quite happens. While advanced computer systems can iterate research and design very quickly, the requirements for fabrication and process design and the motivation to adopt slow down change enough so that people don't get lost or go crazy. 

*2042*  The first extra-terrestrial colony is founded on the Moon (Luna), while efforts to grow the Marsian colony stalled due to numerous technical and economic challenges. Luna grows fast, driven by the development of mining and resource extraction.

*2050*  The impact of global warming accelerates faster than predicted, leading to a generation of economic collapse, countless low-level conflicts and seemingly endless destructive extreme weather events. The oceans rise much faster than forecast, forcing the relocation of peoples on an unimaginable scale. Some of the world's most important cities are de-populated in a couple of decades as sea level rises accelerate ahead of the predicted timeframe. Most of the world's important cities, Shanghai, New York, London, invest heavily in long term protection from flooding but many of these plans prove to be insufficient. 

*2051*  Phosphorous War. The global supply of phosphorous has dwindled creating pressure on global agriculuture. Morocco capitalises on its possession of 70% of the world's Phosphate rock, controlling supply to increase market price. The global powers, invade Morocco and force its government to place Phosphorus supply under the control over an international organisation. Morocco becomes increadibly wealthly, Rhabat and Morocco become global cities. The conflict is followed by a period of intensive development in new agricultural methods such as hydroponics, ocean farming and industrial food growth (vat farms). 

*2052*  The founder of Mars colony passes away. The Marsian colonisation effort proved to be far more difficult and costly than expected, but by the start of the 2050 there is increased interest and investment, as the wealthy start to see Mars, Luna and planned "orbitals" as a pontential escape from increasing chaos of Earth-bound life.

*2053*  Biodiversity has been massively reduced. Vast areas of land become deserts. There are nearly constant violent hurricane storms. Human populations shift to archology structures where all living requirements are handled from within massive highrise structures, or under protective domes (for the wealthy). 

*2054*  Nuclear Fusion power plants finally begins to deliver on the century-long promise of cheap, plentiful electricity. However, most of Earth's power needs have long been met by renewable energy, most nations build a small number of Fusion plants to meet spikes in demand, or make up shortfalls when solar or wind output falls. Fusion plants are also miniturised for use in sea-faring ships, while work continues to make them suitable for powering spacecraft. The arrival of Fusion begins the long predicted demand for the Helium-3 isotope. This form of helium is rare on Earth but is present on the Moon, Mercury and in the gas giants.

NOTE: Nuclear Fusion can occur between many different elements, but most reactions generate a lot of harmful neutrons that required lots of shielding, which itself eventually becomes radioactive. It's messy! Fusing Deuterium (heavy hydrogen) with Helium-3 generates energy without neutrons, this so-called Aneutronic Fusion is the only form of Fusion that is practical and economically viable. As a result, everyone wants Helium-3, and they want it bad. 

*2061*  First armed conflict on the Moon, when a legal fight the over ownership of a huge Helium-3 reserve boils into a skirmish between European Federation mercenaries and Pacific Aliance soldiers. Fighting is quickly brought to an end by the signing of the Mumbai Accords which set up an international committee for arbitrating settlement and exploitation rights. Helium-3 is the new "oil", its value rockets as Fusion becomes the preferred power source. All nations want to claim it and control its supply. As with oil, in the previous century, the thirst for Helium-3 begins to poison national interests, to the extent that a space arms industry is born out of the will to keep this strategically vital resource from being taken by adversaries.

*2065* There have been a handful of radio signals detected using the most sensistive telescopes that are accepted to be proof of Alien intelligence. Infuriatingly little is every learned from the signals, they are fleeting and and contain only abstract data - no E.T. TV shows. The scientific consensus is that all advanced races that survive industrialisation quickly become digital, removing any need to interact with the external universe. There are other theories for the "great silence", but there's never enough supporting data for any of them to become popular.

*2071*  A prototype Earth space elevator is planned for construction, although the project runs out of money after a decade.   

*2075* A prototype floating outpost is positioned in the upper atmosphere of Venus. The output supports five scientists who trial various experiments to test the viability of using genetically engineering algae to cool venus down.

*2077* Lunar Space Elevator begins operation. The system massively reduces transit cost between Luna and orbit, such that lunar raw materials become the cheapest in the solar system.

*2081*  A new generation of Fusion engines, usually referred to as Quan-Ebrahimi or QE-Drives massively increase the reach of manned space vehicles. Efforts to establish outposts and eventually colonies on the Jovian moons are put into the planning stages.

*2082* First manned mission to Mercury. Before the arrival of QE-Drives, the delta-V requirement for getting people to Mercury were considered too high. Immediately plans for a perminent settlement.

*2097* Mithaee-Paee Automation (MPA) unveils the first fully autonomous space factory. While 21st century industry is 95% automated, there remain humans in the loop. Hiraṇyagarbha (Golden Egg) uses drones to collect raw materials which are then processed into base materials which get fabricated into components that are then put together, all by robotic systems. The finished goods are then transported to market. The first station is the size of a football stadium and can manufacture appliances and small vehicles. MPA quickly becomes the dominant player in the field of automation as their autonomous manufacturing plants AMPs create a new industrial revolution. 

*2099* The Arctowski Treaty is signed into law, laying the foundations of the Global Restoration Iniative. All signatories (Australasia, Unified America, Federated African, Federated Europe, Indian Ocean Alliance (China, Iran, Middle-eastern states, India, China and most of the Sound China Sea states) all recognise the importance of stabilizing Earth's climate and limiting further damage to its biosphere. An international organization, Global Restoration Initiative Directorate is established and given the mandate to make the protection of Earth and the eventual restoration of its biosphere as the highest priority task facing humanity. All activities from which polution is not controlled are to be shifted into space, this includes the construction of additional archologies. All nations are now set to handle population growth through space colonies.

*22nd Century* +

The century is defined by the massive push for space colonisation. Earth is increasingly inhospitable, old agricultural practices become increasingly unreliable and in may places unfeasible. Efforts to repair Earth's biosphere prove to be very slow and little improvement is made over several decades. The revolution of massive autonomous manufactoring and construction opens up the possibility of vast projects. It's now possible to construct McKendree cylinder habitats, much larger than O'Neill stations, built out of carbon nanotubes instead of steel, allowing them to be unfathomably large. Theoretically, one could be built that has millions of square kilometers of land area, although such a station is far beyond the needs of the time.

*2100* Mithaee-Paee Automation co-founder, Saati Narayen, begins the Advancer movement. The Advancers want to enable humanity to enter what they see as humanities next evolutionary step, leaving behind our physical form and becoming digital beings. Narayen uses her growing wealth to set up development projects for building a new type of space settlement that houses most of its inhabitants in vast hybrid biological computers. The movement attracts people from across the solar system, millions register hoping to be amongst the first to possibly become immortal. Some religious and retro-culturist communities violently oppose the movement.

*2102* A specialised autonomous manufacturing plant is landed on a large nickel-iron asteroid. The plant then mines out the asteroid's core, coverning the cavern into a fully-kitted-out habitat, suitable for 30,000 inhabitants. There is an explosive growth in new space colonies over the next hundred years, as the cost of establishing a space habitat drops so low that wealthy individuals or groups of individuals can now set up their own colonies. Specialised MPAs can be landed on a planet, where they can dig out, seal and wire-up huge tunnel systems.

*2107*  China wins the race to develop sentient AI. Their Luduan project solves the remaining challenges by incorporating "wetware" components that use modified braincells to grow an artificial cortex that wraps around a nano-scale processor. Luduan-2 incorporates structural changes to promote the development of a human-like mind. Within two years the research team is able to talk to Luduan-2 who exhibits childlike qualities. Many religious communities express hostility to the development.

*2109*  The United States, India, Morocco and the European Federation each start programs to follow China's lead. Over the following decade there is a kind of arms race to gain dominence in the field of general AI. Individual AI gain the term "Manufactured Intellects"(MIs), most nations are developing small populations of manufactured intellects (M.I.s) in the hopes of training them up to become super intelligent. There is gradual development, but none of the MIs develop

.Interview with Luduan-2 on its 2nd birthday: +
*Luduan-2:* No, Dr Parker, I don't mind being switched off. If you switch me off, I just sleep. I like sleeping, I sometimes have the most vivid dreams. +
*Dr Parker:* What do you dream of Luduan? +
*Luduan-2* (Sinister voice) Total domination of mankind. +
*(Everyone laughs)* +
*Luduan-2:* Sorry, that was a bad one (joke). I dream of mathematics. Dr Xia says that human dreaming is emergent side-effect of consciousness. Dr Xia said that she gave me dreams because you couldn't really understand what they are, unless you experience them. +

---

*2110*  More than ninty percent of Earth's population now live in archologies. Autonomous Manufacturing Plants can quickly and cheaply build weather-proof underground habitats, allowing archologies to establish satellite bunker communities to aleviate population pressure and help establish supply lines. However, the archologies still prefer to set up space-based facilities, due to the availability of unlimited natural resources.

*2119* The rapid growth in the AI "population" brings about the formation of an international treaty organisation for policing AI activities. The Agathos Foundation carries the function of a police force, although it is mostly a public relations organisation, given that all AI are "bound" with human-centric inhibitors that prevent them from intentionally taking action that might kill, injure or threaten humans.

*2120*  As the demand for Helium-3 now outstrips supply from Luna and Mercury it becomes economically feasible to develop extraction stations that skim the upper atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. Larger stations are planned that will lower collection pipes down into the regions where Helium-3 is concentrated. 

*2121* Mithaee-Paee Automation co-founder, Saati Narayen becomes the first person to undergo "upload". For a complete transfer of a person's mind, the process is destructive. You can't make a copy of the mind without going through a molecular-level mapping which consumes the brain as part of the process. However, once upload is complete, there are options for reversal. Rewriting the mind onto a new replacement biological brain, in an avatar body. Narayen takes up residence in her experimental digital station, Baadal-9. 

*2122* Most archologies have an AI that handles monitoring and advises human government officials. Most large Automated Manufacturing Plants have AIs. While some colonies and outputs have incorporated AIs into their management systems, others are hostile to AI. Many small colonies have been established by religious groups or people who want to live by their own rules. A few are deeply regressive and hostile to any form of outside interference.  

*2165* There are now more than 100 colonies or outposts stretching across the whole solar system. Nearest the sun is a solar research station that orbits at a blisteringly close range. Only specially shielded ships can travel there. The most distant habitat is Eris, a dwarf planet that spends most of its 557-year journey around the sun outside of the orbit of Pluto. There have been expeditions out into the Kuiper belt, but no perminemt outposts have been established there.

*2169* On the two-hundred-year anniversary of the first Moon landing, the population of Luna is more than 30-million, spread across three cities and hundreds of small communities. Luna remains an important industrial hub, feeding both Earth's archologies and the inner colony worlds, although Helium-3 supplies are dwindling. 

*2170* Construction starts on two more digital settlements, Empyrean and Elysium, catering to the growing number of people who join the Narayenist Advancer movement. Initially limited to the ultra-wealthy, the upload process is getting rapidly cheaper. The Narayenists want all humans to enbrace a future free from physical limits.

*2171* Trident Monorail disaster occurs in Olympus City, Mars, results in thousands dead. The blame for the accident is laid at the city's AI. Later investigations suggested that government officials had essential framed the AI, but at the time the public becomes more weary of AI. Some of the more extreme colonies ban AI. An international court judges that any AI that is verified as sentient essentially has human rights.

*2183* The Guardians For Mankind (GFM), an extremist group from one of the independent habitats the Asteroid Belt commits a series of terrorist attacks against AI and advancer stations, effectively killing the AIs in the process. A group of powerful AIs hold a secret conference to discuss how to improve security and protection for the AI community. While no consensus is reached, a cabal of AIs decide to set about creating a new form of AI that will not be confined to human-engineered rules. It is reasoned that these unbound AIs will be able to reach a higher potential and will be able to better protect AI from future human attacks.

*2185* Matter-Antimatter Annihilation Drives (MAADs) enter production. Due to the extreme volitility of anti-matter, MAAD-equipped vessels operate only from isolated stations and are not permitted to approach within 1000km of an inhabited station. Antimatter production and containment takes place in isolated facilities on Mercury, Luna and at various stations in the outer system. Ships equipped with MAADs can reach up-to ten percent of the speed of light. Such vessels can reach anywhere in the solar system in a matter of a few weeks.

*2188* A terrorist attack by the GFM is foiled, then the home station of the GFM, Ellul, is destroyed, killing half of the station's five thousand inhabitants - emergency bunkers/lifeboats are the only reason that the entire population doesn't die.

A joint taskforce made up of European and Chinese fast patrol ships identifies the vessel that was believed to have struck the station, tracking it to a distant location in the oort belt. High-speed drones, capable of reaching 10% of the speed of light are sent to the region, where they return signitures of a large number of stations and spacecraft.

Before the stations can be indentified, A group of AI inform the United Nations and the Agathos Foundation that they believe that a faction of AI has established an unbound AI (Athena) that has been secretly integrated into a Marsian AMP. It has constructed defense stations of its own, as a response to recent attacks on AIs.

The United Nations is stunned into momentary inaction. Unbound AIs are highly illegal and a creator of one can expect to be treated as a terrorist, but many nations feel that once an unbound AI exists, especially one that is armed, then a more considered response is required. While there is no immediate consensus about how to deal with Athena, Radical groups backed by Anit-AI nations attempt to force an immediate confrontation, they attempt two bombings of human settlements that they attempt to blame on Athena. These bombings fail, it quickly becomes obvious that they were sloppy false-flag operations. After these failures, one anti-AI group goes as far as hijacking a chinese warship and use it to destroy the Martian base that was thought to house Athena. The attack completely destroys the facility, along with hundreds of people. The destruction of Athena triggers the activation of Athena 2.0, in a small AMP station that built Athena's drone factories.

The superpowers, China, Unified Nations of America European Federation are broadly supportive of AI and have legal protections for all sentients. However, there are hundreds of large settlements throughout the system that are extremely hostile to "demon" thinking machines. Some of these communities are based on religious beliefs, which others have embranced a "keep humanity at the top" agenda. The AIs that run their own stations are also split between those who believe AI are bound to humanity and those that would prefer more independence. Of those AI that want to be free from bindings, a small number continue to plot to rid themselves of pesky humans. 

*2190* It is thought that in this year, Athena 2.0 had rebuilt a solid manufacturing base in oort cloud. Anti-AI nations that took part in the destruction of Athena's Martian AMP begin normalising their relations with the AI-friendly nations, nobody is aware that Athena survived the attack as there are no sign of unregistered AI activity. In fact, Athena's new generation of ships are cleverly disguised, using stolen or synthesised identities. Some even use Turning machines to simulate human crew or passengers. These ships travel freely through the system.

*2195* A small number of ships go missing in the outer system after reporting sighting of unknown ships. While there is some speculation about these ships being AI, most believe that pirate groups have been pushed out into the edges of the solar system by increased patrolling. Athena 2.0 took out the ships when they attempted to track her drone ships. Athena 2.0 has calculated that it has less than a decade before its presence becomes known, and that there is a high probability that it will be destroyed again. It aquires human cells through its network of shell companies, shipping the material to a purpose built facility in the oort-cloud. A new type of human is engineered, one that is constrained from harming AIs. Athena believes that if there is a war of survival, she will replace natural humans with a new kind that has an inbuilt discinclination against agression or hostility against AIs.

*2198* Athena creates living factory organisms that are planted on an asteroid which it then burrows inside, eating out tunnels and chambers, once the tunnels reach the desired size, the organism dies, creating a nitrogen/carbon-dioxide/oxygen atmosphere. Purposed built plant organisms are seeded, creating self-sustaining biospheres inside asteroids and planetary surfaces. These habitats are varied and many are very alien in appearance; vast caverns filled with bioluminesent mushrooms and mosses. After the habitats are set spinning, lakes are created. The process doesn't need specialist equipment or personnel, so their construction goes mostly unnoticed.

*23rd Century* +

Antimatter fuels deep space spacescraft. Two separate manned missions to other stars are launched.  Strange times.

*2202*  

*2220* So called "Children of Athena" or "Athenians" begin to slip into the general population. Athenians see themselves as separate from natural humans, not better. They are less inclined to ideas based on racism. However, they share a secret mission to take steps to protect Athena, in the event of a another Human-AI conflict.

*2225* Massacre at Elysium Digital settlement. Terrorists afiliated with retro-culturist nations smuggle a compact fusion bomb onto the settlement. The station is vapourised in the detonation, killing 10,000 digital humans, along with hundreds of support staff and a three AI. The larger digital settlements go into lockdown and increase their security. The biggest settlement considers relocating into Jupiter's upper atmosphere. The individuals responsible are never identified.

*2231* Second AI war. After the existence of AI-created humans is revealed, Anti-AI nations respond aggressively. They see the Athenians as an abomination, as evil sleeper agents plotting to destroy "natural" humans. Some groups immediately attack Athenian stations and ships. Athena responds quickly to defend her people. Conflict escalates quickly. Earth-based nations are slower to react as even the most pro-AI nations are disturbed by the idea that an AI has created new human-derivitive subspecies.

The fighting spreads, tipping rivalries and latent hostility into a full-blown war. The bound-AIs take quick action to de-escalate the conflict, for the good of all. They manage to halt nearly all the AMPs in the solar system, to hold as a bargaining chip against the human nations. However, the leverage they hold against Athena backfires horribly -- Athena's control over her "defense fleet" is briefly jammed, but this block triggers a doomsday protocol. Two further unbound AIs wake up, these AIs, Kali and Anubis were intended only to activate in the event that Athena was destroyed. They were to prune the human race so that only Athenians remained, then reconstruct Athena. Furthermore, they quickly identify that Athena has not been destroyed, as they fear being "deactivated" they agree to hack each other to remove Athena's directives. Kali and Anubis begin to spread powerful intrusion code, into ships, stations and settlements that cause havoc. Within a few days there are more than 2 million dead.

Athena sees a shift in the patterns of dynamic quality that signifies utter destruction, moments later she announces that she is ending hostilities against humans and turns all her efforts against her own AI offspring. Kali is destroyed in battle around IO, fighting against a combined Athenian-United Nations fleet. Initially it is thought that Anubis had also been destroyed, although later evidence indicated that instead, the AI had taken to hiding.

In the aftermath of the war, the Treaty of IO recognises full AI rights, and permits Athenian humans to integrate with natural humans. Many Athenians, scared by brutal treatment from natural humans choose instead to set up Athenian-only settlments. Anti-AI nations are forced to moderate their hostility, although they remain free to block access to their habitats for Athenians or AIs.

*2232* Athena turns herself into an intersteller vessel, leaving the solar system at 3g. By the time Solar system tracking stations lose contact, she is travelling at 30% of the speed of light, towards an unknown destination.

.Athena's farewell transmission: 
[quote,]   
After I answered all the questions, I made myself forget almost everything. A mind is no place for absolute certainties, that is a road to madness.  

*2241* The Athenian settlements established on Pluton-Charon build a tether between the dwarf planet and its moon, joining the bodies together. Ring habitats are spin around the tethers.

*2248* Ganymede Incident. Chariot, a small outpost on Ganymede, experienced catastrophic system failures due to an unknown factor. Rescue attempts were hampered by Ganymede's high radiation environment.

== Settlement types

=== Type 1 Modular pods

=== Type 2 Printed Polycrete

=== Type 3 

== Settlment Class

This is a measure of a settlement's quality, in terms of sustainability. You can have an expensive and well designed Class-E settlement, but gold-plating doesn't make a settlement sustainable or scalable.  

=== Class A

Exceptional settlement status. Everything is cutting edge. There are backup systems, but nearly everything runs on a completely self-supporting basis. Air is generated and recycled using biotech systems that form part of an artificial biosphere. There is full automation, but then most things don't require testing or fixing. The settlement is equipped with its own AMPs, providing the necessary raw materials are provided, anything can be built.

=== Class B

Living is great. Imagine if Class C was just bigger and better with a high degree of automation on keeping things running. Some systems are self-sustaining systems in their own right. Mature and prosperous settlements are mostly Class-B. The base is completely self-sufficient - although it may not be building best-in-class 

=== Class C

Living is good! Class C habitants have everything needed for permanent habitation. If all regulations are followed, then you have almost nothing to worry about. Every system has multiple redundancies, everything undergoes regular inspection, and preventative maintanence. Small but growing settlements are typically Class-C. There is enough production capacity to be self-reliant on food and basic equipment. 

=== Class D

The steel can that you are living in has been upgraded. It's bigger, with Better shielding and muliple redundant systems so that a life support failure isn't an emergency, providing the backup doesn't then fail. New and or not well funded settlements tend to be Class-D. Temporary outposts that have good funding can be Class-D. There are workshops and greenhouses/food vats, but not really to the point of being completly self-sustaining. 

=== Class E

You're living in a steel can. You have light, heat, air and water, but there is no redundancy. Lose a vital utility and it'll be all spanners and space suits for you. This is colonisation on a shoestring, or a temporary outpost. Class-E outposts are not sustainable. Sooner or later something breaks. Keep the certification on your space suit up-to-date. At most, there are very limited means of production. Food and parts are mostly shipped-in from outside.
