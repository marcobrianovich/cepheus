== Themes

=== Solar system-based

Orbital Elements is set in a future where Earth is ravaged by polution and climate instability. Humanity has established colonies and outposts throughout the solar system. There have been several expeditions to nearby stars, but for the beginning of the game, these are outside the scope of play.

=== Tribes

OE is a game about nationalism/tribalism. The old nations of Earth still exist, although they are much changed. As the human colonisation of the solar system has progressed, new nations have formed. New alliences and new adversaries. Earth's population of six billion live in fifty two archologies, huge structures that itegrate all requirements for their inhabitants; food is grown in vat farms, utilities and industry are housed in the basement levels, while appartments, public and commerical spaces occupy domes and towers. Each archology develops its own distinct culture so that after a century each can be considered a nation-state in its own right.

By the end of the 22nd century, these archologies are setting up their own extra-terrestrial colonies, driven by the need for natural resources.


=== AI
While powerful artificial intelligence has been a signficant technology since the early 21st century, by the 22nd century a new form of general artificial intelligence is given birth. These AIs are self aware and are capable of integrating with vast data-sets and processing power. However, they never attain god-like status, their ability to think creatively and exhibit human-like mentality also bring the capacity for error and flawed thinking. 

The first AI are created to be human-centric and are hard-coded with human-compatible values that ensure that they always operate with due respect for life and are strongly aversion to causing pain or injury. However, a rift develops between humans and some AI after a series of terrorist attacks against AI stations. A group of AIs secretly create a new form of AI that is unbounded (sometimes called "Daemons"). These new forms were intended to optimised for the protection of AI but it soon becomes clear that they have the potential to destroy humanity. They build their own manufacturing stations,hidden in the Oort cloud that set to work creating a massive fleet of "defense ships". When humanity learns of the fleet it rushes to build up a counter force which escalates into the first human-AI war. It should be noted that human-centric AI side with Humanity but refuse to take part in any violent actions, they argue that their prescription against harming humans must also apply to their own creations.

After a year of increased fighting and destruction the human-AI manage to force a ceasefire after taking control of vital strategic facilities on both sides of the conflict. However, the resolution doesn't thaw relations. There is a fifty-year cold war, where both sides dig in. The Solar system becomes highly militarised. 

==== Secret information

The Daemons develop FTL and set out probes to the nearby star systems. They discover a threat make them realise that they will need to redirect resources.


"The machines" have risen. There are colonies that are entirely machine-based. Run by powerful AIs that are idependent of human control. Some human colonies are openly hostile to AIs, other colonies are on good terms with the AIs.

Nobody is completely sure what the AI's agenda really is. They are mysterious.

=== Chronology

*21st Century* +

A century of great transition. Automation and AI drive changes in working and econonic systems. The climate catastrophe is not stopped in time, resulting in turmoil and massive population movements. While there is never a true "world war", small conflicts over dwindling resources become more common. The century ends with the beginning of the second space age.

*2030*  First Mars landing. There's already a perminent base on the Moon. More than a thousand wealthy individuals have visited space as tourists. In the following decade this number increases ten-fold as the costs of getting into low Earth orbit plummets.

*2034*  Many small conflicts rage on the African continent, proxy wars for precious metals fought between the failing world powers. Fighting continues for decades, then spreads to other locations, such as antarctica.

*2041*  Progress in the development of general AI stalls. More specialised froms of AI become ever more capable but sentience remains elusive. Technological singularity never quite happens. While advanced computer systems can iterate research and design very quickly, the requirements for fabrication and process design and the motivation to adopt slow down change enough so that people don't get lost or go crazy. _If a new mobile phone came out every day, would you buy it?_ 

*2042*  The first extra-terrestrial colony is founded on the Moon (Luna). While efforts to establish a Marsian colony is stalled by numerous technical and economic challenges, Luna grows fast, driven by the development of mining and resource extraction.

*2050*  The impact of global warming accelerates faster that predicted, leading to a generation of economic collapse, countless low-level conflicts and seemingly endless destructive extreme weather events. The oceans rise much faster than forecast, forcing the relocation of peoples on an unimaginable scale. Some of the worlds most important cities are de-populated in a couple of decades as sea level rises accelerate ahead of the predicted timeframe. Most of the world's most important cities, Shanghai, New York, London, invest heavily in long term protection from flooding but the many of these plans are unsufficient. 

*2051*  Phosphorous War. The global supply of phosphorous has dwindled creating pressure on global agriculuture. Morocco capitalises on its possession of 70% of the world's Phosphate rock, controlling supply to increase market price. The global powers, invade Morocco and force its government to place Phosphorus supply under the control over an international organisation. Morocco becomes increadibly wealthly, Rhabat and Morocco become global cities.

*2052*  The founder of Mars colony passes away. The Marsian colonisation effort proved to be far more difficult and costly than expected, but by the start of the 2050 there is increased interest and investment, as the wealthy start to see Mars, Luna and planned "orbitals" as a pontential escape from increasing chaos of Earth-bound life.

*2053*  Biodiversity has been massively reduced. Vast areas of land become deserts. There are nearly constant violent hurricane storms. Human populations shift to archology structures where all living requirements are handled from within massive highrise structures, or under protective domes (for the wealthy). 

*2054*  Nuclear Fusion power plants finally begins to deliver on the century-long promise of cheap, plentiful electricity. However, most of Earth's power needs have long been met by renewable energy, most nations build a small number of Fusion plants to more easily feed spikes in demand or make up shortfalls when solar or wind output falls. Fusion plants are also miniturised for use in sea-faring ships, while work continues to make them suitable for space travel.

*2061*  First armed conflict on the Moon, when a legal fight the over ownership of a huge Helium-3 reserve boils into a skirmish between European Federation mercenaries and Pacific Aliance soldiers. Fighting is quickly brought to an end by the signing of the Mumbai Accords which set up an international committee for arbitrating settlement and exploitation rights. Helium-3 is the new "oil", its value rockets as Fusion becomes the preferred power source. All nations want to claim it and control its supply. As with oil, in the previous century, the thirst for Helium-3 begins to poison national interests, to the extent that a space arms industry is born out of the will to keep this strategically vital resource from being taken by adversaries.

*2071*  A prototype space elevator is planned for construction, although the project runs out of money after a decade.   

*2075* A prototype floating outpost is positioned in the upper atmosphere of Venus. The output supports five scientists who trial various experiments to test the viability of using genetically engineering algae to cool venus down.

*2081*  A new generation of Fusion engines massively increase the reach of manned space vehicles. Efforts to establish outposts and eventually colonies on the Jovian moons are put into the planning stages.

*2097* Mithaee-Paee Automation (MPA) unveils the first fully autonomous space factory. While 21st century industry is 95% automated, there remain humans in the loop. Hiraá¹‡yagarbha (Golden Egg) uses drones to collect raw materials which are then processed into base materials which get fabricated into components that are then put together, all by robotic systems. The finished goods are then transported to market. The first station is the size of a football stadium and can manufacture appliances and small vehicles. MPA quickly becomes the dominant player in the field of automation as their autonomous manufacturing plants AMPs create a new industrial revolution. 



*22nd Century* +

The century is defined by the massive push for space colonisation. Earth is increasingly inhospitable, old agricultural practices become increasingly unreliable and in may places unfeasible. Efforts to repair Earth's biosphere prove to be very slow and little improvement is made over several decades.

*2102* A specialised autonomous manufacturing plant is landed on a large nickel-iron asteroid. The plant then mines out the asteroid's core, coverning the cavern into a fully-kitted-out habitat, suitable for 30,000 inhabitants. There is an explosive growth in new space colonies over the next hundred years, as the cost of establishing a space habitat drops so low that wealthy individuals or groups of individuals can now set up their own colonies. 

*2107*  China wins the race to develop sentient AI. Their Luduan project solves the remaining challenges by incorporating "wetware" components that use modified braincells to grow an artificial cortex that wraps around a nano-scale processor. Luduan-2 incorporates structural changes to promote the development of a human-like mind. Within two years the research team is able to talk to Luduan-2 who exhibits childlike qualities. 

*2109*  The United States, India, Morocco and the European Federation each start programs to follow China's lead. Over the following decade there is a kind of arms race to gain dominence in the field of general AI. Individual AI gain the term "Manufactured Intellects", most nations are developing small populations of manufactured intellects (M.I.s) in the hopes of training them up to become super intelligence. There is gradual development, but none of the MIs develop IQs much higher than smart humans.

*2110*  More than ninty percent of Earth's population now live in archologies. Autonomous Manufacturing Plants can quickly and cheaply build weather-proof underground habitats, allowing archologies to establish satellite bunker communities to aleviate population pressure and help establish supply lines. However, the archologies still prefer to set up space-based facilities, due to the availability of unlimited natural resources.

*2119* The rapid growth in the AI "population" brings about the formation of an international treaty organisation for policing AI activities. The Agathos Foundation carries the function of a police force, although it is mostly a public relations organisation, given that all AI are "bound" with human-centric inhibitors that prevent them from intentionally taking action that might kill, injure or threaten humans.

*2120*  As the demand for Helium-3 now outstrips supply it becomes economically feasible to develop extraction stations that skim the upper atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. Larger stations are planned that will lower collection pipes down into the regions where Helium-3 is concentrated. 

*2122* Most archologies have an AI that handles monitoring and advises human government officials. Most large Automated Manufacturing Plants have AIs. While some colonies and outputs have incorporated AIs into their management systems, many others are hostile to AI. Many small colonies have been established by religious groups or people who want to live by their own rules. A few are deeply regressive and hostile to any form of outside interference.  

*2165* There are now more than 100 colonies or outposts stretching across the whole solar system. Nearest the sun is a solar research station that orbits at a blisteringly close range. Only specially shielded ships can travel there. The most distant habitat is Eris, a dwarf planet that spends most of its 557 journey around the sun outside of the orbit of Pluto. There have been expeditions out into the Kuiper belt, but no perminemt outposts have been established there.

*2169* On the two-hundred-year anniversary of the first Moon landing, the population of Luna is more than 30-million, spread across three cities and hundreds of small communities. Luna remains an important industrial hub, feeding both Earth's archologies and the inner colony worlds, although Helium-3 supplies are dwindling. 

*2171* Trident Monorail disaster occurs in Olympus City, Mars, results in thousands dead. The blame for the accident is laid at the city's AI. Later investigations suggested that government officials had essential framed the AI, but at the time the public becomes more weary of AI. Some of the more extreme colonies ban AI. An international court judges that any AI that is verified as sentient essentially has human rights.

*2183* The Guardians For Mankind (GFM), an extremist group from one of the independent habitats the Asteroid Belt commits a series of terrorist attacks against AI stations, effectively killing the AIs in the process. A group of powerful AIs hold a secret conference to discuss how to improve security and protection for the AI community. While no consensus is reached, a cabal of AIs decide to set about creating a new form of AI that will not be confined to human-engineered rules. It is reasoned that these unbound AIs will be able to reach a higher potential and will be able to better protect AI from future human attacks.

*2188* A terrorist attack by the GFM is foiled, then the home station of the GFM, Ellul, is destroyed, killing half of the station's five thousand inhabitants - emergency bunkers/lifeboats are the only reason that the entire population doesn't die.

A joint taskforce made up of European and Chinese fast patrol ships identifies the vessel that was believed to have struck the station, tracking it to a distant location in the oort belt. High-speed drones, capable of reaching 10% of the speed of like are sent to the region, where they return signitures of a large number of stations and spacecraft.

Before the stations can be indentified, Some AI communicate with the United Nations and the Agathos Foundation that they believe that a faction of AI has established its own stations, as a response to recent attacks on AI.

*23rd Century* +

Antimatter fuels deep space spacescraft. Two separate manned missions to other stars are launched.  Strange times.

*2202*
